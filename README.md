# BASIC EVENT TRACKER

- For SNUCC SDE inductions
- Started out with Elixir + Phoenix, but due to lack of time ended up doing basic python version of it
- cd into python_script_version and run: `python3 event_tracker.py` for CLI version and `python3 event_management_platform_gui.py` for GUI version
- No point in running Phoenix as of now, can look at code in folder event_management_platform if interested
